      <h1>about</h1>
      <p><strong>Poets in Need</strong> is a non-profit organization founded in 2000 with a bequest from the poet Philip Whalen. Its mission is to provide emergency assistance to poets who have an established presence in the literary community as innovators in the field and a substantive body of published work.</p>
      <p>Assistance is given only in cases of current financial need that is in excess of and unrelated to the recipientâ€™s normal economic situation and that is the result of recent emergency (due, for example, to fire, flood, eviction, or a medical crisis).</p>
